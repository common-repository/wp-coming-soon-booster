== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the difference between Coming Soon Page Mode and Maintenance Mode? =

Coming Soon Page Mode return a http status 200 and allows your site to be indexed by Google and other searching engine. You should always using Coming Soon Page mode when your site is new.

Maintenance Mode returns a http status code 503 and should be used when you are doing short term maintenance on an existing site. This will let search engines know your site is under going maintenance and should return in 1 day when maintenance mode is finished.

= Disabled Coming Soon Plugin and it still shows =

This is always a caching issue. Check if you have a caching plugin installed and if it is installed, clear the cache.

= I can't see the landing page I've just created! =

As long as you're logged in as admin, you cannot see it. That's what this plugin does! It displays Maintenance or Landing page only to non-logged or non-admin logged visitors of your page. By this way you can work on your real website and display different page to your visitors. You can preview the page by clicking on "preview" tab, loggout from WordPress or access your website from different browser.

= 503 or 200 HTTP codes, huh? =

OK, it's easy if you want to display Coming Soon page you usually wants to search and crawling engines (like Google) to be able to index your website. In that case you need to response with 200 HTTP "OK" to set Coming Soon mode.

On the other hand if you have your website already up and running but you are doing only a short maintenance it's better to send out response 503 HTTP Service unavailable code. By that way you make sure the search engines do not index your temporarily website while it's down to maintenance and do not lower your website SEO score.
